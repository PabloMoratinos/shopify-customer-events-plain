This is a Shopify Customer Events tracking project for both non-ecommerce and ecommerce events. 
It pushes events' data into the data layer, from where it can be retrieved using a tag manager system (e.g. Google Tag Manager) and sent to different vendors like Google Analytics, Google Ads, and others.
